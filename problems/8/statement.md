# Find Missing Number

Given a list of integers that contains all numbers from 0 up to and including `n` in a contiguous range except one, find the missing number.

**Constraints:**

- 1 ≤ len(list) ≤ 100
- The list contains all integers in a range [min, max] except exactly one
- Numbers may appear in any order

**Examples:**

`f([0, 1, 3, 4, 5])` returns `2`

`f([5, 6, 3, 0, 1, 2])` returns `4`
