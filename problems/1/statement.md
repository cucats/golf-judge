# Manhattan Distance

Given a matrix comprised of zeros and exactly two nonzero values, return the
Manhattan distance between the two positions that have nonzero values.

**Constraints:**

- 2 ≤ rows, cols ≤ 20
- Exactly 2 nonzero values in the matrix
- Manhattan distance = |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|

**Example:**

If the matrix has a 2 at position (2, 5) and an 8 at position (5, 10), the
Manhattan distance is |2-5| + |5-10| = 3 + 5 = 8
